# Mantik agent instructions

Mantik is a Go/PostgreSQL autonomous paper-research service with terminal
clients. Its bootstrap is a synthetic, unqualified lifecycle fixture.

## Boundaries

- Keep research, decision evaluation, and operations separate.
- Evaluation exchanges structured evidence. Generate narrative explanations
  only from finalized decisions and their evidence. Preserve original source
  material for targeted inspection.
- Operations acts only on finalized, applicable decisions and enforces their
  safety contract. It must work independently of model availability.
- Every executable strategy version needs safety conditions and evaluations.
- Keep real observations, synthetic fixtures, and qualification evidence
  distinct. Never imply profitability from the demonstration.
- Do not connect to existing Augr data or production services during bootstrap.
- Preserve the Open Pilot forms and PR template. Draft issues are not pickup
  approval; add pickup labels only to reviewed, bounded work.
- Keep secrets, local data, binaries, and generated evidence out of Git.

## Verification

Use the pinned Go 1.26.9 toolchain (`mise exec -- …`). Run `make verify` for
changes. Run `make test-race` for concurrent behavior and `make test-integration`
for storage/schema changes. Integration uses new disposable containers and
must never use a development or production database. Run `make compose-build`
when application dependencies or container behavior change.

Wrap new `httptest` servers with `loopbacktest.GoClientOnly`: other local
processes, such as T3 port detection, connect to loopback test servers, and an
unwrapped fake can count or reject their requests as if Mantik sent them.

Update README and maintained docs when contracts, commands, or boundaries
change. Use ordinary feature branches and reviewable PRs on the GitHub origin.
